== Cross-cutting Concepts


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
This section describes overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are
relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system.
Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks.
They can include many different topics, such as

* domain models
* architecture patterns or design patterns
* rules for using specific technology
* principal, often technical decisions of overall decisions
* implementation rules

.Motivation
Concepts form the basis for _conceptual integrity_ (consistency, homogeneity)
of the architecture. Thus, they are an important contribution to achieve inner qualities of your system.

Some of these concepts cannot be assigned to individual building blocks
(e.g. security or safety). This is the place in the template that we provided for a
cohesive specification of such concepts.

.Form
The form can be varied:

* concept papers with any kind of structure
* cross-cutting model excerpts or scenarios using notations of the architecture views
* sample implementations, especially for technical concepts
* reference to typical usage of standard frameworks (e.g. using Hibernate for object/relational mapping)

.Structure
A potential (but not mandatory) structure for this section could be:

* Domain concepts
* User Experience concepts (UX)
* Safety and security concepts
* Architecture and design patterns
* "Under-the-hood"
* development concepts
* operational concepts

Note: it might be difficult to assign individual concepts to one specific topic
on this list.

=== Domain model

[plantuml,"Domain model",png]
----
class User {
webId : String
}
class SavedLocation {
    location : Location
    name : String
}
class Comment {
    text : String
}
User --> "0..*" User : friendOf
User --> "0..*" SavedLocation : saves
User --> "0..*" Comment : posts
SavedLocation --> "0..*" Comment : contains
----
The idea is to use the *Location* js object for the content of *SavedLocation* objects because it's what we get from geolocation API and we are using React Native for the mobile app. We will only store the pod identifier of each user in order to preserve privacy.

=== User Experience concepts

Our idea is to minimize the technical requirements to use the app. We want to abstract as much complexity as possible from the pod use and provide user a plug-n-play experience. For this reason, we will prioritize focusing on ease of use rather than adding obscure features that could worsen UX.

=== Additional libraries

Apart from the already mentioned framework or services, our intention is to use the following libraries for the reason stated next to them:

* solid-auth-client: we will use it for login functionality.

* ldflex-for-solid: for using data through LDflex expressions.

* solid-react: basic React components for building Solid components and applications.

* solid-react-components: react components for Solid applications.

* react-router-dom: in order to assign URLs to each page.

*React Redux* will also be used for our data stores in order to easily update our component's state. 

=== Safety and security concepts

We will use HTTPS with TLS protocol to ensure the communication from the mobile app to the web server is done securely because it may contain sensible information such as the user pod's id and location which could be used to link a person's identity to a pod. SaveLocations will be stored in our server along with its webId but everything else such as friends will be stored in user's pod.
