|With this runtime environment for JS we will be able to design an scalable web application, oriented to asynchronous events
|We are new to the tool, so it will take some time to get used to it

|Windows, Linux, and Android
|The application have two parts, one web application that will be supported by every browser,
and a native mobile app for Android
|We will not suport iOS devices, and for using the localization part of the app the user must carry a smartphone

web and in mobile versions, using react native in the latter
